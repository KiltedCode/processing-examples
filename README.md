# processing-examples

This is a collection of example programs for the processing programming language. These are various programs written by me while teaching an intro computing course at a local community college. They're a combination of in-class examples, homeworks, and coding portions of the test that I'm now putting here as code samples.

## Processing

Processing is described as sketching with code, a tool created to make it easier to sketch ideas in code and is also great for quick visual feedback when learning to code. To run any of the code examples, you'll need to [download Processing](https://processing.org/download/) on your machine.
